# Roblox RPG Framework
*Not the same as an Engine stop calling it that*  
This is, as anything with a name like that would be, a framework for creating
RPG games on Roblox. Currently, it is in its foundational stage and has no set
structure of scripts with various things subject to change without too much
warning.  

**I don't have an excuse for not warning you. Likewise, you don't have an excuse
for when not listening breaks your code**

As a guideline for contribution, just fork and make changes to whatever you
want to make changes to, then submit a pull request. Make sure you have clear
commit notes, and your reason for the pull request is well founded and clearly
stated. Remember to document any integrations, entry points, injections and
usage notes either in commit messages or in an actual documentation file for the
parts you have worked on.

**Valkyrie Support Status: Minimal**  
**Readiness-level: Not a chance**
